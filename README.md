# FIPS PUB 10-4

This standard is obsolete but is useful when working with historical data like census data. Amazingly, all changes were recorded into pdf form. This is an attempt to create an easy to digest endpoint for computer systems. Currently, pdf extraction is done by tabula. A somewhat handheld process.

## Why ?

Even though the spec was removed it has been consistently updated. It is utilized as a seed reference for the new standard along with many other standards.


## About

FIPS PUB 10-4 was withdrawn by the National Institute of Standards and Technology on September 2, 2008 based on Public Law 104-113 (codified OMB Circular A-119 and the National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act of 1995). The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA), as the maintenance agency for FIPS PUB 10-4, has continued to maintain and provide regular updates to its content in a document known as Geopolitical Entities and Codes (GEC) (Formerly FIPS PUB 10-4). 

The Geopolitical Entities, Names, and Codes (GENC) Standard, the US Government profile of ISO 3166, has subsequently been designated as the replacement standard for FIPS PUB 10-4. The GENC Standard will provide a list of the basic geopolitical entities in the world, together with the principal divisions that comprise each entity. The names of the political entities are derived from official meeting records of the Foreign Names Committee of the US Board on Geographic Names (US BGN). GENC Edition 1 was published on 27 November 2012 and only includes codes at the country level. GENC Edition 2 was published on 31 March 2014. The GENC Standard may be found online at: https://nsgreg.nga.mil/doc/view?i=2379. The GENC content may be found in the GENC Registry online at: https://nsgreg.nga.mil/genc/discovery. 

The GNS will continue to use GEC country codes for the near future. NGA will continue to maintain Geopolitical Entities and Codes (Formerly FIPS PUB 10-4) until the deadline for implementation of the GENC Standard (date still pending publication of a DoD memorandum), after which point there will likely be a transition period during which both GEC (FIPS 10-4) and GENC codes are available to the GNS user.
